## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned tons about this project, I think it stretched me a bit especially the footer was a little pain in the ass however, I made it through so yeah ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜Š

### Continued development

This project was all about layouts so i think going forward i will continue improving my skills in layout building in css.

### Useful resources
